# Deploy a Java-based MicroProfile service to Azure Web App for Containers

MicroProfile is a great way to build exceedingly tiny Java applications that can be quickly and easily deployed to services such as [Azure Web App for Containers](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/containers/). In this repo we have the code referenced in the '[Deploy a Java-based MicroProfile service to Azure Web App for Containers](https://docs.microsoft.com/java/azure/microprofile/deploy-microprofile-to-web-app-for-containers)' tutorial on the [Azure for Java developers](https://docs.microsoft.com/java/azure/) documentation site. This tutorial creates a simple MicroProfile-based microservice that is then containerized into a Docker container, deployed into an [Azure Container Registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/container-registry/), and then hosted using Azure Web App for Containers.

To learn more about how Microsoft enables developers to use MicroProfile on Azure, check out the [Eclipse MicroProfile on Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/java/azure/microprofile/) section on the Microsoft Docs website.
